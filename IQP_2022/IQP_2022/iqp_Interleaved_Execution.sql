/*	The MS TVF and dbo.Person are joined using a Nested Loops join 
	because the	estimated row count for the MS TVF is only 100 rows.

	Unfortunately, the actual row count is 12345, so this a very 
	expensive way to join the 2 tables as it requires 12345 lookups 
	into the clustered index.

	Notice that the plan includes a Sort operator.  DISTINCT requires 
	that the data be ordered to exclude duplicate values.  
	Also notice that we've got a sort warning.  Because of the low 
	estimated row count we weren't allocated adequate memory to sort 
	the output of the Nested Loops join in memory, so it had to do 
	some of the work of sorting on disk adding physical I/O to the 
	query execution.  I/O is slow, physical I/O is really slow.

	---------------------------------------------------------------------------

	If you aren't yet on SQL Server 2017, try to address problematic 
	MS TVFs by	leveraging CTEs, views or temp tables instead - or by
	replacing them with inline TVFs.  */

/*
	Looking at the estimated and actual row counts for the Table scan we 
	find that they're both 12345!  This is Interleaved Execution in action.
	The higher estimated row count leads the Optimizer to use a hash match
	join (a cheaper	choice) and to request a larger memory grant so 
	we don't spill to disk this	time.  

	Another indication that the Optimzer knows we're working with higher
	row counts is the use of a Hash Match (Aggregate) operator to do the
	DISTINCT work. This is a more efficient means of sorting large amounts
	of data.*/
