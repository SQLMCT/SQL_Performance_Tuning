-- Getting missing index information for all of the databases on the instance is very useful
-- Look at last user seek time, number of user seeks to help determine source and importance
-- Also look at avg_user_impact and avg_total_user_cost to help determine importance
-- SQL Server is overly eager to add included columns, so beware
-- Do not just blindly add indexes that show up from this query!!!
-- Håkan Winther has given me some great suggestions for this query
