	Using Trace flag 8676 we can see details on which Stage and Phase
	of optimization is being used. This is an undocumented trace flag
	and should not be used in a production environment.
	Verify in Messages tab what was done in which optimization phase
	of the Query Optimizer after each execution

	The "end search(x)" values indicate the phase of the 
	Query Optimizer the query reached:
		- Transaction Processing (Phase 0)
		- Quick Plan (Phase 1)
		- Full Optimization (Phase 2)
			
	Also verify StatementOptmEarlyAbortReason and StatementOptmLevel 
	values in XML. Note that StatementOptmLevel only shows values
	TRIVIAL or FULL

	The complexity of the query qualified it for Phase 1 optimization.
	At the end of Phase 1 optimization the best plan found had a cost 
	exceeding the current "cost threshold of parallelism (default of 5).
	So parallel plans where evaluated.

	There are two search(1) lines in the trace flag output. 
	The plan having the lower output (Serial vs Parallel) will be passed
	to Phase 2. In this example, the plan was immediately returned without 
	need to go to Full optimization. (We don't see search(2) in the output.)
